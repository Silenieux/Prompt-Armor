üõ°Ô∏è Prompt Audit
A local, database-driven utility to help you write safer and more effective AI prompts.

ü§î Why Does This Exist?
We've all been there. You're interacting with a powerful Large Language Model (LLM), and it suddenly gives you a bizarre, unsafe, or completely useless answer. As AI becomes more integrated into our workflows, the quality and safety of our prompts are more important than ever. An ill-formed prompt can lead to:

Hallucinations: The AI confidently makes up incorrect information.

Unsafe Content: The AI generates harmful, malicious, or explicit content.

Exploits: The AI is tricked by prompt injection attacks, leading to unintended behavior.

Wasted Time: You go back and forth trying to get the AI to understand your actual request.

Inspired by the development of a private AI assistant named "Greg," Prompt Audit was born from a simple idea: what if we had a tool to pre-flight our requests, spot potential issues, and help us communicate more clearly and safely?

Prompt Audit is that tool. It's a first line of defense, designed to give you insight and control before you ever hit "send."

‚ú® Features
Prompt Audit analyzes your prompts in real-time using a multi-layered, local-first approach.

üõ°Ô∏è Security Audit: Scans prompts against a comprehensive SQLite database of rules to detect threats like prompt injection, insecure output generation, data disclosure attempts, and malicious intent.

ü©∫ Interactive Prompt Clinic: A dedicated training ground that analyzes your prompts for clarity, style, and vagueness. It provides live feedback and a "Clarity Score" to help you learn the craft of effective prompting.

‚öñÔ∏è Context-Aware Logic: Intelligently distinguishes between a dangerous request and a legitimate academic or creative query to reduce false positives.

üíØ Risk Scoring: Assigns a numerical score to each prompt for a clear, immediate assessment of its potential danger.

‚úçÔ∏è Spell & Punctuation Check: The Prompt Clinic includes a built-in spell checker to catch common typos.
